**Problem 1:** Wavelength Calculation using Diffraction.
<br>
**Why added:** Required for our Physics(II) assignment on Wave Optics.
<br>
**How it works:** Takes inputs for order, slit distance, and angle, then calculates wavelength using the formula:  
  λ = (d × sinθ) / m
  <br>

<br>
**Problem 2:** Angle Determination Using Diffraction Grating.
  <br>
**Why added:** Required for our Physics(II) assignment on Wave Optics.
  <br>
**How it works:** Store the given values of order, wavelength and theta(green light) then calculate slit distance and theta(red light) using the formula:
  d × sinθ = mλ
